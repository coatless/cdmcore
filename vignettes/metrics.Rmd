## Q Matrix

To assess the accuracy associated with estimating $\mathbf{Q}$ we employ both
matrix- and element-wise recovery rates across replication $r$. 
As the estimation is valid up to a permutation, we present the accuracy rates 
after permutating the estimated Q matrix across all trait (column) orderings.
Once the Q matrix has been permutated, we then compute and show
the respective metric.

**Matrix-wise recovery rate** is defined as:
$$
\frac{1}{R}\sum _{r=1}^R\mathcal I(\widehat{{Q}}^{(r)}=\widehat{Q})
$$

**Element-wise recovery rate** is defined as:
$$
\frac{1}{R}\sum _{r=1}^R\frac{1}{JK}\sum _{j=1}^J\sum _{k=1}^K\mathcal I(\hat{q}_{jk}^{(r)}=q_{jk})
$$
